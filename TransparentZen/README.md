Make the Zen Browser's background transparent allowing the macOS system window blur or Windows mica blur to come through. Untested on GNU based Gnome or KDE environments.

### Note
> You will need to manually toggle the `browser.tabs.allow_transparent_browser` flag in `about:config` to `true`.

> And you may use any CSS injector to make your favorite website's background transparent :) I prefer the StyleBot extension and if you are interested, [here's my backup](https://gist.github.com/sameerasw/9d9e2b9cb5517a2821b376f8868be46b) for 15+ websites.
> 
> Just `background-color: #00000000 !important` it.
