# Transparent Zen
Make the Zen Browser's background transparent allowing the macOS system window blur or Windows mica blur to come through. Known to be supported on macOS, Windows 11, KDE and Hyprland but Windows 10 is not supported while Gnome doesn't have a propper implementation for transparency either.

Website specific transparency need to be achieved with the [Zen Internet addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zen-internet/).

## Feature explanation

1. `"Allow Zen browser to be transparent"` - This will toggle the `browser.tabs.allow_transparent_browser` flag in `about:config` to `true`. This remove the default backplate from the browser webpage view so it shows what's behind it instead so when the browser sidebar is also transparent, this allows the whole webpage to be transparent as well (if the webpage also modified to be transparent with the addon). Turn off before uninstalling since this will not be reset by Zen.

2. `"Custom background color"` - These two options allows you to override the default workspace theme gradient and colors and use a custom color for it to instantly apply themes like Nord if you use it's default background color. You can also use expanded css properties like `light-dark(#fff, #222)` here so it becomes dynamic.

3. `"Light tint settings"` - Zen 1.8b added a white tint to the background of the webpage but it does not switch to a dark color in the dark theme. These options allows you to either flip the color or to completely remove the tint.

4. `"Make empty page transparent"` - Zen when no tabs open and if the new tab page is disabled, Shows an empty screen but here the background is solid. This setting allows it to be transparent.
